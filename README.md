# Capo-Transposition-Program-for-Guitar-Chords
This is a simple python program which takes names of chords from user along with the fret number where the capo is on and returns the transposed chords so that you can play songs without using a capo.
Instructions:
* Enter the number of chords you wanna transpose
* Enter the names of chords one by one like Amin,Cadd9,Gmaj,Emin7 etc.
* Enter the fret number on which you would like the capo transposition of

***UPDATE***:
I have converted the python script into a working web-app developed using Flask. The web app is hosted via "Python Anywhere". It works in the same way as previously instructed. Changes made to the code is the additional code of Flask and some error handling of possible or allowed chord names has been done. I will try to keep on updating the list of allowed chord names as the possibilities of genuine chord names are endless.
